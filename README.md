- **Many cloud storage providers** (all via rclone config import, some without ui-setup)
- **Material 3 Design** (Dark theme)
- **All architectures** (runs on ARM, ARM64, x86 and x64 devices, Android 7+)

Intentservice
-------------
This app includes the ability to launch an intent! Create a task to sync to a remote, and copy it's id (via the treedot-menu)
The intent needs the following:

| Intent        | Content       |         |
| :------------- | :-------------: | -------------: |
| packageName      | ca.pkay.rcloneexplorer | |
| className      | ca.pkay.rcloneexplorer.Services.SyncService | |
| Action    | START_TASK | |
| Integer Extra    | task | idOfTask |
| Boolean Extra    | notification | true or false |

Installation
------------
Grab the [latest version](https://github.com/x0b/rcx/releases/latest) of the signed APK and install it on your phone. You can also [register for the closed Google Play testing group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rcx-alpha/join), the [Google Play Beta](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/io.github.x0b.rcx), or on [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/io.github.x0b.rcx).

| CPU architecture | Where to find | APK identifier |
|:---|:--|:---:|
|ARM 32 Bit | older devices | ```armeabi-v7a``` |
|**ARM 64 Bit** | **most devices** | ```arm64-v8a``` |
|Intel/AMD 32 Bit | some TV boxes and tablets | ```x86``` |
|Intel/AMD 64 Bit | some emulators | ```x86_64``` |

If you don't know which version to pick use ```rcx-<version>-universal-release.apk```. Most devices run ARM 64 Bit, and 64 Bit devices often can also run the respective 32 bit version at lower performance. The app runs on any phone, tablet or TV with Android 7 or newer, as long as you have a touchscreen or mouse.

Usage
------------
[See the documentation](https://x0b.github.io/docs/).

Developing
------------
[See the developer-documentation](https://x0b.github.io/dev/).

Build rclone manually run:

```
./gradlew rclone:buildAll
```

When building rclone with a go version that is too old (eg 1.15.5), this error may show up:

```
ld.lld: error: duplicate symbol: x_cgo_inittls
```

It can be fixed by using a more recent version of go.

Known Issues
------------
- Reauthorization of OAuth remotes shows intermittent failures. This is currently under investigation.
- Theming is currently not applied properly.
